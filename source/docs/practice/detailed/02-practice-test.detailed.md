**Question:** [023]  
During a project, a developer uses **Copilot** and generated code accidentally includes **personal identifiers** from a public dataset, and later an audit reveals a custom Copilot extension was trained on **real customer data without consent**. Which actions best demonstrate **Accountability** while addressing the **Privacy and Security** violation? **Choose two.**

**Options:**  
A. Ignore the issues because the data was public or eventually anonymized.  
B. **Remove personal identifiers** from the codebase, **report the incident**, and **document** technical and process changes to prevent recurrence.  
C. Quietly **retrain** the model on a different dataset without recording what happened.  
D. **Escalate** the misuse of customer data, **document transparently** what went wrong, **enforce or update policies** to require consent before using real customer data, and maintain an **auditable record**.

<details> <summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary> **Correct Answer(s):** B, D

</details> 

**Explanation:**  
**Accountability** requires owning outcomes, escalating incidents, and documenting corrective actions. **Privacy and Security** is violated when real customer data is used without consent, remediation includes removing sensitive data, reporting, and policy enforcement to prevent recurrence.

**Question:** [024]  
A Copilot for Business customer wants to ensure employees’ **private repositories**, **prompts**, and **completions** are **not used to train** the Copilot model. A developer proposes adding **sensitive user attributes** to training data to improve **fairness**, but this would exceed user **consent**. Which statement best reflects the correct Responsible AI priority and product behavior?

**Options:**  
A. **Privacy and Security** should take precedence, private repositories, prompts, and completions in **Copilot Business/Enterprise** are **not used** to retrain the base models, and fairness should be improved using **synthetic** or **privacy-preserving** methods that respect consent.  
B. **Fairness** should take precedence, equal performance matters more than consent about data use.  
C. **Transparency** is most important, documenting the data use is sufficient.  
D. **Inclusiveness** should override privacy so more groups can be represented in training.

<details> <summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary> **Correct Answer(s):** A

</details> 

**Explanation:**  
**Privacy and Security** requires using data only for **consented, legitimate** purposes and protecting confidentiality. With **Copilot Business/Enterprise**, **private code, prompts, and completions** are **not used** to train the base models, preserving IP and privacy. When privacy and fairness goals are in tension, pursue **fairness** via **privacy-preserving** techniques rather than expanding sensitive data without consent.

**Tips and Tricks:**  
- If the stem emphasizes **consent, data use limits, and confidentiality**, choose **Privacy and Security**.  
- Improve fairness using **synthetic data**, **aggregation**, or **privacy-preserving learning**, not by violating **consent**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Prioritize **consent** and **data minimization**, then address **fairness** with techniques that **do not** expand access to sensitive attributes.
